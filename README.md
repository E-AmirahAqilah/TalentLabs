# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Part 1: Project Introduction
In this project, you are going to build a Tic-Tac-Toe game in the command 
line interface. Two players, X and O are going to take turns picking their next 
move by entering the numbers in the command line (See the screenshot on 
the right-hand side.)
